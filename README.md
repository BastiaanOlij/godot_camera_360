Godot 360 Camera render
=======================

This repository contains an example implementation of rendering a scene to a cubemap and then turning that cubemap into a panoramic image.

Recording the output of this would produce a 360 degree video.

Currently it doesn't yet support stereoscopic rendering so there is no depth perception.
